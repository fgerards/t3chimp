MailChimp extension for Typo3. See the wiki for documentation: https://github.com/matoilic/t3chimp/wiki

Currently the extension only supports the inclusion of subscription forms in the front end. If you have any wishes for further integration e.g. with other extensions or if you find any bugs just create a ticket.

If you have any other questions or need support feel free to contact me through the form on my homepage http://matoilic.ch
